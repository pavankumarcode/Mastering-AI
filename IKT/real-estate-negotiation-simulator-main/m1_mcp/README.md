# Module 1 — MCP Servers (`m1_mcp`)

**Requires:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the GitHub demo. No API key needed for the pricing/inventory servers standalone.

This module introduces **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — the standard that lets AI agents call external tools without knowing where the data comes from.

---

## What this module teaches

A naive negotiation agent uses hardcoded prices — the agents have no real market data and just make up numbers.

MCP fixes that. It is a protocol that:
1. Lets a server **expose tools** (functions with typed inputs/outputs)
2. Lets a client **discover** those tools automatically (`list_tools`)
3. Lets a client **call** those tools over a standard interface (`call_tool`)

The agent doesn't need to know if the data comes from a database, an API, or a spreadsheet. It just calls the tool by name.

---

## File breakdown

### `github_agent_client.py` — An LLM agent that uses GitHub via MCP

This file connects to **GitHub's official MCP server** and lets GPT-4o decide which tools to call based on your natural language query.

Why GitHub? Because you already know what GitHub does. Seeing an LLM agent use MCP with a familiar tool makes the protocol click before you write your own servers.

**What it demonstrates:**
- Connecting to an MCP server over `stdio` transport
- Auto-discovering tools via `list_tools` and converting schemas to OpenAI function-calling format
- The LLM **choosing** which tools to call (agentic, not scripted)
- The ReAct-style tool loop: LLM calls tools, gets results, calls more tools or answers
- This is the **same pattern** used by our ADK buyer/seller agents in Module 2 (via `MCPToolset`)

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- A GitHub Personal Access Token (`repo` or `public_repo` scope)
- An OpenAI API key

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
python m1_mcp/github_agent_client.py

# Or with a custom query:
python m1_mcp/github_agent_client.py "Find popular MCP server implementations"
```

---

### `sse_agent_client.py` — SSE agent client (connects over HTTP)

An LLM-powered agent that connects to the pricing and/or inventory servers running in **SSE mode** (HTTP) and lets GPT-4o decide which tools to call — the same agentic pattern as `github_agent_client.py`, just a different transport.

**What it demonstrates:**
- Connecting to MCP servers via SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport
- The LLM **choosing** which tools to call (agentic, not scripted)
- Connecting to multiple MCP servers from a single agent
- Proving the transport is irrelevant — same protocol, same agent loop

**Prerequisites:**
- Start the servers in SSE mode first (in separate terminals)
- An OpenAI API key

```bash
# Terminal 1:
python m1_mcp/pricing_server.py --sse --port 8001

# Terminal 2:
python m1_mcp/inventory_server.py --sse --port 8002

# Terminal 3 — run the agent:
python m1_mcp/sse_agent_client.py                                          # all sample queries
python m1_mcp/sse_agent_client.py "Is this property overpriced?"            # custom query
python m1_mcp/sse_agent_client.py --both "Use inventory and pricing data"   # both servers
```

---

### `pricing_server.py` — Custom MCP server for market pricing

This is the first custom MCP server. It wraps simulated real estate pricing data and exposes it as MCP tools.

**Tools it exposes:**

| Tool | What it does | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `get_market_price(address, property_type)` | Returns comparable sales, estimated value, and market analysis | Both buyer and seller |
| `calculate_discount(base_price, market_condition, days_on_market, property_condition)` | Returns suggested offer ranges and negotiation tips | Both buyer and seller |

**Two transport modes (same server, different usage):**

```bash
# stdio — default, client spawns this as a subprocess (used by Modules 3 + 4)
python m1_mcp/pricing_server.py

# SSE — HTTP server, multiple clients can connect at once
python m1_mcp/pricing_server.py --sse --port 8001
```

In Modules 3 and 4, the agents start this server automatically as a subprocess. You don't need to run it manually — but you *can* to inspect it.

---

### `inventory_server.py` — Custom MCP server for inventory + seller constraints

This server simulates an MLS (Multiple Listing Service) system. It has one public tool and one **seller-only** tool.

**Tools it exposes:**

| Tool | What it does | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `get_inventory_level(zip_code)` | Returns active listings, days on market, market condition | Both buyer and seller |
| `get_minimum_acceptable_price(property_id)` | Returns the seller's absolute floor price | **Seller only** |

**The information asymmetry lesson:**

The buyer agent never connects to `get_minimum_acceptable_price`. This is intentional — in real estate, only the seller's agent knows the seller's walk-away price. The seller uses this tool to set a hard floor; the buyer has to negotiate without knowing it.

This is the same pattern used in real production systems: MCP access control means different agents get different tools.

```bash
# stdio — default
python m1_mcp/inventory_server.py

# SSE
python m1_mcp/inventory_server.py --sse --port 8002
```

## MCP in one diagram

```
AGENT                       MCP Protocol              SERVER
─────────────────           ────────────────          ──────────────────
"What tools exist?"
await session.list_tools() ─────────────────────────> Returns tool schemas
                                                       [{name, description,
                                                         inputSchema}]

"Call this tool"
await session.call_tool(    ─────────────────────────> Executes Python fn
  "get_market_price",
  {"address": "742..."}
)
                           <───────────────────────── Returns result dict
"Comps avg $462K,
listing is 4.9% above
market. I'll offer $425K."
```

The agent never imports your Python functions directly. It talks to the server over the protocol — the same way whether the server is local or remote.

## How to run

```bash
# GitHub MCP agent (needs GITHUB_TOKEN + OPENAI_API_KEY + Node.js)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
python m1_mcp/github_agent_client.py

# Inspect pricing server tools (no API key needed)
python m1_mcp/pricing_server.py
# Then Ctrl+C to stop (it's a server, it waits for connections)

# Inspect inventory server tools (no API key needed)
python m1_mcp/inventory_server.py

# SSE mode — run in one terminal, connect from another
python m1_mcp/pricing_server.py --sse --port 8001
python m1_mcp/inventory_server.py --sse --port 8002

# Then connect with the SSE agent client (in another terminal)
python m1_mcp/sse_agent_client.py                    # all sample queries (pricing only)
python m1_mcp/sse_agent_client.py --both              # includes inventory queries too
```

**What to expect from the GitHub agent:**
- It connects to GitHub's server via `npx`
- Lists all available tools (there are ~20+)
- GPT-4o decides which tools to call based on your query
- Executes the tool calls via MCP and feeds results back
- Produces a natural language summary

**What to expect from the pricing/inventory servers:**
- They start and wait for a client to connect
- On their own they don't print much — they're servers
- In Modules 3 and 4, the agents connect to them automatically

## Deep-dive demos (`m1_mcp/demos/`)

Standalone, runnable scripts that crack open the MCP protocol so you can see what's happening on the wire. Each one is self-contained and prints what it sends/receives. Read them in order; companion notes live in [m1_mcp/notes/mcp_deep_dive.md](m1_mcp/notes/mcp_deep_dive.md).

| Demo | What it shows | Run |
|---|---|---|
| [`01_initialize_handshake.py`](m1_mcp/demos/01_initialize_handshake.py) | Raw JSON-RPC frames of the MCP `initialize` handshake (no SDK) — capability negotiation, `notifications/initialized`, then `tools/list` | `python m1_mcp/demos/01_initialize_handshake.py` |
| [`02_tool_loop_trace.py`](m1_mcp/demos/02_tool_loop_trace.py) | The full **model ↔ host ↔ server** tool-calling loop, narrated step by step with timestamps (uses the `mcp` SDK + OpenAI function calling) | `python m1_mcp/demos/02_tool_loop_trace.py` |
| [`03_list_all_primitives.py`](m1_mcp/demos/03_list_all_primitives.py) | Lists **Tools, Resources, and Prompts** from both workshop servers — proves MCP carries more than just tools | `python m1_mcp/demos/03_list_all_primitives.py` |
| [`04_content_types.py`](m1_mcp/demos/04_content_types.py) | A tiny inline server that returns each `Content` block kind (text / image / embedded resource) so you can see the JSON shape of each | `python m1_mcp/demos/04_content_types.py` |
| [`05_streamable_http_transport.py`](m1_mcp/demos/05_streamable_http_transport.py) | Same MCP protocol, **Streamable HTTP** transport (the spec's recommended replacement for raw SSE) | Server: `python m1_mcp/demos/05_streamable_http_transport.py --serve --port 8765`<br>Client: `python m1_mcp/demos/05_streamable_http_transport.py --client --port 8765` |

> Demos 01–04 spawn their own server subprocess — no manual setup. Only demo 05 needs two terminals.

## Inspect visually with the MCP Inspector

The demos above show the protocol in your terminal. The **MCP Inspector** is the official browser-based GUI host — it connects to any MCP server and renders **Tools, Resources, and Prompts in separate tabs**, so you can *see* a generic host treat each primitive type differently (exactly what Claude Desktop does when it wires tools into the model loop, lists prompts as slash-commands, and shows resources in its attachment picker).

No Python code or API key needed — it runs via `npx` (Node.js 18+). Point it at either server:

```bash
# Inventory server — 2 tools + 1 resource (inventory://floor-prices)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python m1_mcp/inventory_server.py

# Pricing server — 2 tools + 1 prompt (negotiation-tactics)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python m1_mcp/pricing_server.py
```

> On Windows, if `python` is not the workshop venv, use its interpreter explicitly:
> `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector .venv\Scripts\python.exe m1_mcp\inventory_server.py`

Open the printed `http://localhost:6274?...` URL, click **Connect** (this runs the same `initialize` + `*/list` discovery as demo 03), then explore the tabs:

| Tab | Try this | The lesson |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | Run `get_minimum_acceptable_price` with `742-evergreen-austin-78701` | A model-invokable action with typed args — the host gives you a form + "Run" |
| **Resources** | Read `inventory://floor-prices` | You *read* it; there's no args form. The host never "calls" a resource |
| **Prompts** *(pricing server)* | Render `negotiation-tactics` with `role=seller` | A user-selected template — surfaced for a human to pick, not the model |

This is the visual companion to [`03_list_all_primitives.py`](m1_mcp/demos/03_list_all_primitives.py): that script *lists* the primitives on the wire; the Inspector *renders* them the way a real host would — sorting them into tabs purely from the `type` each was declared with, with zero Inspector-specific code from you.

---

## Try it in a full chat host (Claude Desktop)

The Inspector is a debug GUI. **Claude Desktop** is a production MCP host — wiring these servers into it shows the primitives inside a real chat, exactly as an end user would meet them.

**1. Install** Claude Desktop from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) and sign in.

**2. Register the servers.** Open **Settings → Developer → Edit Config** (this opens the correct `claude_desktop_config.json`) and add an `mcpServers` block — use **absolute paths** and the **venv's** `python.exe` so the `mcp` dependency is available:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "real-estate-pricing": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\real-estate-negotiation-simulator\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\real-estate-negotiation-simulator\\m1_mcp\\pricing_server.py"]
    },
    "real-estate-inventory": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\real-estate-negotiation-simulator\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\real-estate-negotiation-simulator\\m1_mcp\\inventory_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Config file location (the **Edit Config** button always opens the right one):
- **Windows (standalone install):** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows (Microsoft Store install):** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

> JSON on Windows needs **doubled backslashes** (`\\`). If the file already has other keys (preferences, etc.), just add `mcpServers` alongside them — don't overwrite the file.

**3. Fully restart** Claude Desktop — quit from the **system tray** (right-click → Quit), not just the window. Config is read only at launch.

**4. Verify:** the **tools icon** in the chat input bar lists both servers and their tools; **Settings → Developer** shows each server's status (click a red one for its error log — almost always a wrong path or non-venv Python).

**5. See each primitive type in a real chat:**
- **Tool** — ask: *"What's the market price for 742 Evergreen Terrace, Austin TX 78701?"* Claude asks to run `get_market_price`, then answers from the result.
- **Prompt** — the **`+` / attachment** menu surfaces `negotiation-tactics`; pick it, set `role=seller`, and it drops into the chat.
- **Resource** — the same menu lets you attach `inventory://floor-prices` as context. You *attach* it — Claude never "calls" it.

Same servers, same primitives you saw in the Inspector — now inside a production host.

## Exercises

Three hands-on exercises designed for the **2-hour follow-up review session** held a few days after the workshop. Try them as homework; the instructor will walk through and run each solution live in class.

| Exercise | Difficulty | Task |
|---|---|---|
| [`ex01_walk_score_tool.md`](exercises/ex01_walk_score_tool.md) | `[Starter]` | Add a `get_walk_score(zip_code)` tool to `pricing_server.py`. Restart `adk web`, ask a walkability question, watch GPT-4o auto-discover and call the new tool with zero agent-side changes. |
| [`ex02_multi_server_agent.md`](exercises/ex02_multi_server_agent.md) | `[Core]` | Build an `LlmAgent` from scratch that connects to BOTH `pricing_server` and `inventory_server` simultaneously. Test with cross-server queries; understand how ADK merges tool catalogs across multiple `MCPToolset`s. |
| [`ex03_server_failure_handling.md`](exercises/ex03_server_failure_handling.md) | `[Core]` | Build a multi-server agent that gracefully handles MCP server crashes — detects tool failures via `after_tool_callback` and degrades with fallback responses instead of crashing. The #1 production resilience pattern. |

Each solution lives in `solution/<exercise_name>/` as a self-contained, runnable package. The instructor walks through each solution live during the review session.

## Quick mental model
- If you want to see *how to build* an MCP server, read `pricing_server.py` (simpler, 2 tools) then `inventory_server.py` (adds the seller-only tool).
- The `@mcp.tool()` decorator is all you need to expose a Python function as an MCP tool.
- In Modules 3 and 4, both agents use these servers — you don't need to start them manually.
